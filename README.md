# color-python

A little python project of mine that is still being worked on.
The idea is that you should be able to input colors in text and get an RGB/Hex code back, you can also create your own colors.

COMMANDS:
- Exit the program: exit
- Print the color: print 'color-name'
- Inverse the color: inverse 'color-name'
- Add color: add 'color-name' 'n n n'

TODO:
- Store colours in txt file
- Visual colours (Tktinker/webpage)

Please, do come with suggestions as to what to do!
